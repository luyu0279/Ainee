## Project Structure

- `app/` - Main Python backend application
- `web_crawler/` - Node.js web crawler service
- `web/` - Web frontend

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Node.js 19+
- pnpm (for Node.js package management)
- Docker (recommended for database setup)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (if not using Docker)
- Redis 6+ (if not using Docker)

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Database Setup

#### Using Docker

```bash
# Create a Docker network for the services
docker network create ainee-network

# Start PostgreSQL
docker run -d \
  --name ainee-postgres \
  --network ainee-network \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ainee \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d \
  postgres:14

# Start Redis
docker run -d \
  --name ainee-redis \
  --network ainee-network \
  -p 6399:6379 \
  redis:6

# Restore database
docker cp data/ainee_localhost-2025_05_21_18_08_33-dump.sql ainee-postgres:/tmp/
docker exec -it ainee-postgres psql -U postgres -d ainee -f /tmp/ainee_localhost-2025_05_21_18_08_33-dump.sql
```

To stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker stop ainee-postgres ainee-redis
docker rm ainee-postgres ainee-redis
docker network rm ainee-network
```

---

### 2. Python Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ainee

# Create and activate Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations

> **Note:** For the backend to interact with Firebase services (like authentication), you need to configure the Firebase Admin SDK using a service account. Ensure *all* necessary service account credentials (e.g., private key, client email, client id, etc.) are set as environment variables in your `.env` file. Refer to the `init_firebase_credential` function in `app/libs/firebase/index.py` to identify the specific credentials required and how they are used.

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start the backend service (main app and Celery workers):

In separate terminals:

```bash
# Start the main app
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Start the content worker
celery -A app.workers.content worker -l info -c 4 -Q content_queue -n content_worker@%h

# Start the rag worker
celery -A app.workers.rag worker -l info -c 4 -Q rag_queue -n rag_worker@%h
```

> **Note:** You must run the main app and both Celery workers (content-worker and rag-parser) at the same time for full functionality.

#### RagFlow Dependency

The `rag_worker` Celery worker relies on a deployed instance of [RagFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow), an open-source RAG engine.  
Please refer to the [RagFlow documentation](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) for setup instructions.

### 3. Node.js Services Setup

#### Ainee Web Service

> **Note:** For web login functionality, ensure you have configured Firebase with your project details. You can find the configuration in `web/src/lib/firebase.ts`.

```bash
cd app/api/ainee_web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

#### Web Crawler Service

```bash
cd web_crawler
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
